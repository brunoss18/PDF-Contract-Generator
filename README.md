## Problem

- High demand of students enrolling in the school.
- Editing contracts used to take 10 to 20 minutes per contract.

## Solution

With the implementation of this Contract Generator, editing contracts has become much simpler and quicker. A process that previously took 10 to 20 minutes can now be completed in just 3 minutes.
